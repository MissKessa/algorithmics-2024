//BACKTRACKING PROBLEM: CYCLES OF A NODE IN A GRAPH
package topics.seminar_5;

/* This class calculates by backtracking all simple cycles 
 * there are in a graph starting in a node v[source]. 
 * 
 * This problem is very similar to the traveling salesman 
 * problem and is also a NP problem, i.e., it has not a 
 * polynomial solution. Difference between both problems:
 * 	- Traveling Salesman Problem => COMPLETE CYCLES
 *  - Cycles of a node in a graph => SIMPLE CYCLES
 *  
 *  Note that for the worst case of the complete graph, as 
 *  soon as n grows, the time complexity becomes 
 *  untreatable because it is factorial */
