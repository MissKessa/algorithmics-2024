//BACKTRACKING PROBLEM: PATH BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT NODES OF A GRAPH
package topics.seminar_4;

/* This class calculates, in a graph, the lowest cost simple
 * path (the best) from a source node v[source] to a destination 
 * node v[target] (source <> target).
 * 
 * This problem is NOT a NP one, i.e., it has a polynomial 
 * solution since, for example Floyd, solves this problem with 
 * a cubic polynomial cost O(n^3)
 * 
 * In spite of having best solutions, we will solve it by 
 * backtracking, developing in depth the state tree of 
 * the graph. */
