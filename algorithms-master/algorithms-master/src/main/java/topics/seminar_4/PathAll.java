//BACKTRACKING PROBLEM: PATH BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT NODES OF A GRAPH

 * from a  source node v[source] to a destination node 
 * v[target] (source <> destination) having a cost equal to 
 * a given threshold.
 * 
 * These paths must be smaller than 10*n nodes.

 * Test the program using different examples */
