//BACKTRACKING PROBLEM: PATH BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT NODES OF A GRAPH
package topics.seminar_4;

/* This class calculates, in a graph, the highest cost simple
 * path (the worst) from a source node v[source] to a destination 
 * node v[target] (source <> target).
 * 
 * This problem is a NP one, i.e., it has not a polynomial 
 * solution. We will solve it by backtracking, developing 
 * in depth the state tree of the graph.
 * 
 * For the worst case of the complete graph, as soon as n 
 * grows, the problem becomes untreatable because it has a 
 * factorial time complexity.
 * 
 * When calculating the highest cost path, prune cannot be 
 * done. However, we can do it when calculating the lowest 
 * cost path */
